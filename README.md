# Titanic-prediction-model
This project is a machine learning model built to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle's Titanic:Machine Learning from Disaster competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data). The objective is to predict whether a passenger survived or not, based on features such as age, gender, class, and other attributes.

# Project Workflow
# 1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned the dataset by filling missing values, particularly in the Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns.
- Engineered new features, such as extracting the deck information from the Cabin feature.
- Converted categorical variables like Sex and Embarked into numerical formats for model training.
